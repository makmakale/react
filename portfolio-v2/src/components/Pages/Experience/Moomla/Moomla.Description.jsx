      <h4>Why Moomla?</h4>
      <p>
        On previous job I often worked with Joomla and since my name is Maksim, I decided to name it "Moomla".
      </p>

      <h4>What is this?</h4>
      <p>
        This is online shop with client side made on React and handlebars for admin panel. Admin panel based on
        JoomShopping plugin. For database I decided to use MongoDB since it was new for me and looks like basic json.
      </p>
    </ProjectDescription>

export default MoomlaDescription;
